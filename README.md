# CRUD With PHP

## Lesson Objectives
*By the end of this lesson, developers will be able to:*

1. **Route** URLs to php files
2. **Connect** to MySQL
3. **Build** CRUD functionality with PHP

## Setup

1. Create a new directory inside your MAMP Web Server root called `php_cars`. 
2. cd into it, and `touch` a new file called `.htaccess`

<!--WDI6 1:53 -->

## Route URLs to php files

Routing can be accomplished with a `.htaccess` file placed in your root directory for the app.  

<details><summary>(It will look like this)</summary>
	
```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^users/[0-9]+$ server.php
```

</details>
It uses regular expressions to map urls to files.

Before we can use our `.htaccess` file, we will need to change a security setting.  Go into your `httpd.conf` file in `/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache` and change the following

```
<FilesMatch "^\.ht">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
    Satisfy All
</FilesMatch>
```

to `Allow` your `.htaccess` file.

```
<FilesMatch "^\.ht">
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    Satisfy All
</FilesMatch>
```

Once this change is made, you will need to `Stop Servers` and `Start Servers` in your MAMP console if it was already running.

<!--WDI6 2:02 -->

## Connect to MySQL

In the last unit, we did all of our connections to PostgreSQL, and we used the Sequelize tool to make our job easier.  With MAMP, we make connections directly to MySQL (very similar to PostgreSQL, but with a few minor differences).

A simple database connection and querying looks like this:

```php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "root";
$dbname = "phpexample";

// Create connection
 $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
 if ($conn->connect_error) {
  die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
$sql = "SELECT * FROM cars";
$this->results = $conn->query($sql);
$conn->close();
```

Looping through the results would go like this:

```php
<?php while($row = $this->cars->fetch_object()): ?>
 <!-- print_r($row); -->
 <li>
  <?= $row->brand ?>:
  <?= $row->num_wheels ?>
 </li>
<?php endwhile; ?>
```

## The Task

We need an app to keep track of all the cool cars we have.  How are we going to do this?  With a CRUD app!  If we were building this in Javascript, this would be old hat.  Since PHP is new to us, though, we'll go a little slower.

### Getting started

1. Make sure you have Sequel Pro, and can run a socket connection:
	- Download [SequelPro](http://www.sequelpro.com/download) install/open it
	- Click 'Socket' as your connection type
	- Fill in the following info:
		- Host: 127.0.0.1 (same as localhost - this doesn't need to be filled in)
		- Username: root
		- Password: root
	- Click Connect

1. Inside Sequel Pro, open the `Query` tab, and create the `phpcrud` database, by typing the following command in the white text box and selecting `Run Previous`:
```sql
	CREATE DATABASE phpcrud;
```

1. Select `phpcrud` from the `Choose Database...` dropdown in the top left of the screen.

1. Once this is done, we need to create a table for all the cars we are going to add.  Run the following query in `Sequel Pro`:

	```sql
	CREATE TABLE cars (
		id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
		car VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
		owner VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
	);
	```

1. `INSERT` a car into your table with a `car` and `owner` field.

```sql
	INSERT INTO cars VALUES (1, 'Quinjet', 'Hulk');
```

1. Make sure your car is in the table before moving on.

<!--WDI6 2:23  -->
<!--2:23 before moving on to next step -->

### Hello PHP

1. Create a `views` directory inside your `php_cars` directory.

1. Create a `cars` directory inside your `views` directory.

1. Create an `index.php` file inside your `cars` directory.  Give it an HTML boilerplate, and an `<h1>` tag that says "Cars Index Page".

1. Go to `http://localhost:8888/php_cars/views/cars/`, and see your beautiful work!

<!--WDI6 2:30 -->

### Getting our car from the DB

<!--Actually 2:28 before starting this step -->

Hard-coded text is great and all, but as with any CRUD route, we need to do two more things before we are really "full-stack": we need routes, and we need to talk to the DB.  That's where our `.htaccess` file comes in! We'll also need to connect to MySQL.

1. Inside our `.htaccess` file, put the following lines inside:

	```
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteRule ^cars/$ controllers/cars.php?action=index
	RewriteRule ^cars$ controllers/cars.php?action=index
	```
	
1. You can probably guess what's coming next.  That controller folder and file we just referenced in `.htaccess`?  We need to create that. (Do that now.)

1. Since this is a PHP file, we need to create a `<?php` tag.  Also, notice that we have a **V**iew and a **C**ontroller.  Are we missing something?  Yes we are.  And we'll get there soon enough.  For now, start your `cars.php` file this way:

	```php
	<?php

	require('../models/car.php');

	?>
	```
	
<!--WDI6 2:39 -->

1. We'll get to the model file in just a bit.  For now, though, we need to build out that `action=index` we put in query params earlier. Place it under the `require` statement in `cars.php`.

	```php
	if($_GET['action'] == 'index') {
		$new_car_controller->indexPage();
	}
	```

1. Wait, `$new_car_controller`?  We never created one of those.  Hold your horses, we're getting there. Place this above your `if` statement:

	```php
	Class CarController {

		public function indexPage(){
			$cars = Car::find();
			require('../views/cars/index.php');
		}
	}
	```

1. Alright, there's our `indexPage()`, but what about the `$new_car_controller`?  Well, take a look at that first word and think for a second what we want to do...think back to our OOP classes, and you'll get:

	```php
	$new_car_controller = new CarController();
	```

1. Noice!  Make sure all of this code is in the proper order (PHP, like JS, reads top-down, so you can't use any variables above where they are created), then our controller is good to go.

<details><summary> . . . hint hint . . .</summary>

```php
	<?php
		require('../models/car.php');

		Class CarController {

			public function indexPage(){
				$cars = Car::find();
				require('../views/cars/index.php');
			}
		}

		$new_car_controller = new CarController();

		if($_GET['action'] == 'index') {
			$new_car_controller->indexPage();
		}
	?>
```

</details>

<!--WDI6 2:48 -->

1. Now it's time for our (America's Next Top) model! ![(America's Next Top) model](https://media.giphy.com/media/26FKX7B7L6cfHPVIY/giphy.gif).  

Create a `models` folder and put a `car.php` file inside it.

1. Start out the model with another class:

	```php
	<?php
		Class Car {

		}
	?>
	```
	
1. Now we need to give it that `Car::find()` function we are using in the controller.  Put this inside the Class:

	```php
	static public function find() {
		$servername = 'localhost';
		$username = 'root';
		$password = 'root';
		$dbname = 'phpcrud';
	}
	```

<!--Look familiar??  -->
<!--WDI6 2:58  -->
	
1. Make sure the above matches your DB name and login parameters for MySQL, then add in the meat of the function DIRECTLY AFTER the setup variables:

	```php
	$mysql_connection = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
	```

1. Since we want to escalate any issues we see, we need to make sure this connection actually worked - that means we need a conditional. We have a MySQL connection, much like our earlier Mongo and PostgreSQL connections. But just like with those tools, the connection is only the first step - we also need to get our data.

	```php
	if($mysql_connection->connect_error){
		$mysql_connection->close();
		die('Connection Failed: ' . $mysql_connection->connect_error);
	} else {
		$sql = "SELECT * FROM cars;";
		$results = $mysql_connection->query($sql);
		return $results;
	}
	```

<details><summary>(Psst . . . That `car.php` file is tricky - it should look like this)</summary>

```php
	<?php
	Class Car {
		static public function find() {
			$servername = 'localhost';
			$username = 'root';
			$password = 'root';
			$dbname = 'phpcrud';
			$mysql_connection = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

		if($mysql_connection->connect_error){
			$mysql_connection->close();
			die('Connection Failed: ' . $mysql_connection->connect_error);
		} else {
			$sql = "SELECT * FROM cars;";
			$results = $mysql_connection->query($sql);
			return $results;
		}
		}
	}
	?>
```

</details>

1. Last piece. Our `index.php` for cars is still a blank template.  Let's get some cars in there.  Add this to the `views/cars/index.php` file below your `h1`:

	```php
	  <section>
	      <ul>
		  <?php while($row = $cars->fetch_object()): ?>
		      <li>
			  Here is a <?php echo $row->car ?> for <?php echo $row->owner?>
		      </li>
		  <?php endwhile; ?>
	      </ul>
	  </section>	
	  ```

1. If you restart your MAMP server, and go to `http://localhost:8888/php_cars/cars/`, you should see the car you created during setup!

>**Note:** That's `http://localhost:8888/php_cars/cars/`, not `http://localhost:8888/php_cars/cars`, and not `http://localhost:8888/php_cars/views/cars/`.

### The "C" in CRUD

OK, so now we can *see* our cars.  Now we need to be able to *save* new ones.  For this, we will have to make a *create* and *new* route.  We'll start the same place we did last time, in `.htaccess`.

1. Add these two lines to your `.htaccess` file:

	```php
	RewriteRule ^cars/new$ controllers/cars.php?action=new
	RewriteRule ^cars/create$ controllers/cars.php?action=create
	```
	
1. Now we need to create those two actions in `cars.php`.  Use the pattern we used for `index` to make two more conditionals for `new` and `create`.

	<details><summary>Try writing out a skeleton before checking here</summary>
	
	```php
	if($_GET['action'] == 'index') {
		$new_car_controller->indexPage();
	} else if($_GET['action']=='new') {
		$new_car_controller->newPage();
	} else if($_GET['action']=='create') {
		$new_car_controller->createAction();
	}
	```
	
	</details>

1. And we need to create those two functions.  Try creating `newPage()` on your own (it's very similar to `index()`).

	<details><summary>Try writing out a skeleton for `createAction()` before checking here</summary>
	
	```php
	public function newPage(){
		require('../views/cars/new.php');
	}

	public function createAction() {
		Car::create($_POST['car'], $_POST['owner']);
		header('Location: ./');
	}
	```
	
	</details>
	
1. Now we need to head over to `models/car.php` to make the `Car::create()` method.  This is almost identical to the `Car::find()` method except for two crucial details: your SQL query will be different, and you need to pass in parameters.  Those lines will look like this, respectively:

	```php
	static public function create($car, $owner) {
	```

	```php
	} else {
		$sql = "INSERT INTO cars (car, owner) VALUES ('".$car."','".$owner."');";
		$mysql_connection->query($sql);
	}
	```
	
	

1. Once you've combined the lines above with your `find()` method to make a full `create()` method, we're ready to circle back to our views.  Create a new view in `views/cars` called `new.php`.  All you need on this page is some HTML boilerplate, a heading, and a form.  The form will have two `<input>`s, one with a `name` of "car", and the other with a `name` of "owner".  What should the `submit` `action` and `method` be?

<details><summary>Example solution</summary>

```html
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	    <head>
	    </head>
	    <body>
			<h1>Add a New Car To The List</h1>
			<form action="create" method="POST">
			    <input type="text" name="car" placeholder="Maserati"/><br/>
			    <input type="text" name="owner" placeholder="How May I Butcher Your Anme?"/><br/>
			    <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
			</form>
	    </body>
	</html>
```

</details>

1. Add a link to your `index.php` that takes you to your `new.php`.  (What should it route to, based on your `.htaccess` file?)

1. Now go back to `http://localhost:8888/php_cars/cars/`, and add a new car.  Yee haw!

### Challenge Yourself

OK, now we can Read and Create cars.  Wouldn't it be cool if we could Update and Delete them?  Think about a few things and then Google your way to a solution.

- What would the SQL query look like for Delete or Update?
- What would the route look like in `.htaccess`?
- How can you re-use the code we already have?

If you get stuck, remember to:

- Check all the logs in `/Applications/MAMP/logs`
- Ask your neighbors

### Another challenge

Connecting to MySQL with every DB request?  That's silly, and it's not DRY.  Create a `connection.php` file and `require` it wherever you need it, rather than repeating the connection all over the place.
